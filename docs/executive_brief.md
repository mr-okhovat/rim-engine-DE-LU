# RIM Engine (DE-LU) — Executive Risk Regime Brief

**Audience:** Senior management, risk committees, portfolio leadership  
**Purpose:** Provide a concise, explainable snapshot of current market risk conditions in the DE-LU power market.

---

## What the RIM Score Represents

The Risk Regime Index (RIM_0_100) summarizes **current market stress conditions** by aggregating four transparent drivers:
price dynamics, load dynamics, renewable stress, and balance pressure proxies.

It is a **context indicator**, not a forecast.  
Higher values indicate structurally tighter and more volatile market conditions.

## Current Regime Snapshot (Template)

- **RIM_0_100:**  ___  (Low / Moderate / Elevated / High)
- **Dominant drivers:**  PD / LD / RES / IMB
- **Regime type:**  Calm / Transitional / Stress
- **Persistence risk:**  Low / Medium / High (qualitative)

This snapshot reflects **current operating conditions**, not expected outcomes.

---

## Key Drivers (Explainability Layer)

- **Price Dynamics (PD):**  
  Indicates the degree of price tension versus benchmarks. Elevated values signal scarcity, congestion effects, or structural tightness.

- **Load Dynamics (LD):**  
  Captures volatility and ramps in demand. High values increase operational uncertainty.

- **Renewable Stress (RES):**  
  Reflects variability or shortfall in renewable availability relative to expectations.

- **Imbalance Pressure (IMB):**  
  A deterministic proxy indicating balance tightness; not a settlement price.

Each driver is independently observable and bounded.

## Implications for the Organization

A higher-risk regime typically implies:
- increased PnL volatility,
- reduced reliability of static assumptions,
- greater sensitivity to operational shocks,
- higher value of coordination and situational awareness.

This does **not** imply losses, but it does imply **heightened uncertainty**.

---

## What Leadership Should Not Conclude

- This is not a price forecast.
- This does not predict duration or reversal timing.
- This does not recommend trades or positions.
- This does not assign causality beyond factor definitions.

The RIM Engine informs **how difficult the environment is**, not **what will happen next**.

---

## Confidence and Limitations

The RIM Engine is:
- deterministic,
- reproducible,
- explainable,
- grounded in observable market behavior.

It is designed to support **better decisions under uncertainty**, not to eliminate uncertainty.
