# RIM Evaluation Metrics — Definitions

## Regime Share
Fraction of total hours classified in each regime.

## Average Regime Duration
Mean length (hours) of contiguous regime segments.

## Transition Matrix
Counts of regime-to-regime transitions (e.g. moderate → high).

## Stress Coincidence Rate
Share of high-regime hours coinciding with:
- top-quartile price volatility
- top-quartile price ramps

## Factor Dominance
For high regimes, the factor with the largest normalized contribution
(PD, LD, RES, or IMB).

No single metric is decisive; interpretation is holistic.
